<h2><b>Truth Whips Fiction.</b></h2>

<p class="ph p2"><i>Love and Sin.&mdash;Fatality of the Metropolis.&mdash;Domestic
Vices.&mdash;Virgins Beware.&mdash;Parsons
Profess too much, and Practice too little.&mdash;“We
must be Cruel to be Kind.”&mdash;A Terrible
Example.&mdash;Let Sacred Teachers Warn
their precarious Daughters to Avoid the
Snares of Music and Fiction.</i></p>

<p class="p2">In the shades of twilight, amid the perfume
of the sunny zones, sat a pale and attenuated
student from the northern climes, musing of
his native vales and hills, and the sweet idol
of his heart, whose latest thoughts he had just
perused. He had consumed too much midnight
oil at college, and his health was gone,
and he sought the towering bluffs of Natchez
for restoration, where he was a sophomoric
pastor. The figs, and flowers, and balmy
breezes restored his health, and he returned
to his native latitudes, and married one of
Eve’s most fascinating posterity. He preached</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">In dale and vill,<br />
And shore and hill,</p>

<p class="pn1">and came to the metropolis, and cast a gauntlet
to Dr. Wainwright on bishops and crinoline,
which made owls screech, and worms
squirm, and frogs sing, and alligators grimly
grin, and snakes and toads hiss and belch sepulchrals.
Wainwright boldly seized the
gauntlet shaft, and the sacred pugilists closed
like panthers, and the people hissed, and
laughed, and applauded, as the battle raged,
and Bennett filled the air with his most comic
darts, which made the <i>Herald</i> sell like Slievegammon
news. We had worms and boils, and
salt rheum, and ate Graham-bread and mush,
and slept with Horace Greeley in Barclay
street, till our bones did rattle, and we could
not laugh beyond a whisper, and</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">Our shanks were so thin,<br />
That negroes did grin,<br />
And, as we passed by,<br />
Dogs and cats did cry.</p>

<p class="pn1">“Long time in even scale the battle hung,”
until Potts and Wainwright retired from the
field as conquerors, in the estimation of themselves
and enthusiastic friends. The sun and
moon and romantic stars performed their
wonted evolutions, and Potts and Wainwright
had their salaries increased, and rose to Bishoprics
and the giddy alpines of the godly avenues,
and we went to the setting sun, and almost
beyond the world. On our return from
the bleak, and shady, and snowy slopes of the
Rocky Mountains, in 1849, we dwelt with
Mrs. Mitchell, at the corner of Houston and
McDougal streets, whose family consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
her daughter, two nieces, a sister, and Otto
Dressel, a teacher of piano music, whose style
was soft, pensive, sacred, and bewitching. We
had boarded with Mrs. Mitchell, in Broadway,
eight years previous, and in 1841, while going
up the dark alley that led to Jackson’s pawnbroker’s
shop in Reade street, we met Mrs.
Mitchell coming down the lane, who sneezed
while we coughed, when we both passed on
with crimson cheeks and sly glances of each
other. Otto Dressel’s sleeping apartment at
Mrs. Mitchell’s in Houston street, in 1849, was
next to ours; and many a summer eve, while
reclining on our couch, has Otto borne us into
the unconscious realms of Morpheus, with his
soothing and entrancing music. The pale
and rosy and dark-eyed offspring of the
mother and departed sister, were ever at
his door, and perhaps too often within, or
on the music side of his portal. We often
heard the thrilling echo of kisses, and the
sudden tap of his piano, to drown the reverberation
emblems of a lover or libertine. And
we often warned the mother and sister of the
fatal intimacy between the music serpent, and
the pretty virgins of their blood. But they
smiled, and said: “O, fy;” and we let the
music-teacher have his way, and he kissed
and hugged the lovely maidens to his heart’s
content. The eldest girl was Julia Mitchell,
who drew near one evening while we were
seated on the sofa, (with no light save the
milky rays of an autumnal moon,) when she
said: “Stephen, can you keep a secret?”
“Yes.” “Then listen: Otto Dressel, you
perceive, is morose and reserved, and dignified
at our table, but he is a thorough scamp,
and so loquacious when alone in the presence
of pretty girls, that his tongue rattles like a
rattlesnake; and his music, in the society of
spotless virgins, is so alluring, as to enrapture,
and bewitch, and deprive them of self-control
and consciousness. Almost every
evening, the beautiful, and musical, and intellectual
daughter of the Rev. Doctor George
Potts archly and slyly drops gilded notes on
our steps, when Otto, who is watching her
arrival from his bedroom window, runs down
stairs with the velocity of a deer, and clutches
the pale and lovely missives, and bounds up
stairs like a bloodhound. Otto is her music-teacher,
and he tells me that he reads with
her, at her father’s and elsewhere, all the latest
English, French and German works of fiction,
which fill her impulsive genius with the
profoundest romance and fatality. It is about
the period of her appearance, and I desire you
to take a position at the window, and behold
how prettily, and gracefully, and archly, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
leaves her mysterious note for her adored
Otto.” We sat near the window, screened by
the lattice and gauzy curtains, and presently
we behold her in the distance; and, after gazing
at Otto’s window, she discovers him on
the watch, and rapidly crosses the street, and,
after leering cautiously around, she softly
places the letter on the steps, and hastily departs,
when down comes Otto, like a vulture
for its prey, or like Putnam down the rocky
precipice, or like the Falls of the eternal Niagara,
and seizes the pretty note, and flies
like an eagle to his celestial cloister. Julia
gently smiles, and intently gazes at us, and we
at her, in the profoundest silence, when we
arise, and pace across the moonlight rays that
gild the rainbow carpet, in disconcerted meditation.
Julia becomes alarmed, and exclaims:
“Stephen, you seem agitated and bewildered,
and I fear you will disclose in Bennett’s <i>Herald</i>
what you have seen to-night.” We assured
her that we would not, and then she besought
us, in plaintive tones, never to divulge our
painful observations to the Reverend Doctor
Potts, and we assented, and soon retired, but
could not repose, and arose and paced the
room, and in fancy rambled through our early
days, and parted the lattice, and gazed upon
the autumnal firmament, and counted its brilliant
constellations. We saw the meteors fall,
and heard the watchman’s solemn cry, and
closed the lattice and retired, (with the imprudent
Parson’s daughter, like an affrighted
ghost, flitting before our midnight vision,) and
there was no repose for us. We tossed hither
and thither, like a vessel in a storm, and
heard the doleful clock measure the passing
hours, and heard the shrill music of the King
of hens, and gladly hailed the first pale ray of
the morning twilight that lit upon our nose,
and we arise, and enter the exhilerating atmosphere,
and stroll with the earliest rays of
Aurora, as she gilds the hills and sacred skies.
We pace the streets in excited contemplation,
and waggons, and rustics, and butchers, and
debauchees, and homeless wanderers pass us
in rapid succession, for whose hard and mysterious
destiny, our poor heart beats high in
tearful sympathy. We pass on, and intoxicated
girls, of incomparable beauty, reeled by
our side, who had just emerged from dens of
infamy, where they had been decoyed, and
their virginity forever blighted by incarnate
demons. We rove through the commodious
Park, bearing the enchanting name of Washington,
and recline beneath its mellifluous
foliage, and soliloquize in the mental disquietude
of Aristotle, when he apostrophised on
his expiring pillow, with his arms across his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
breast, and his deluged vision turned to Heaven:
“O God! I entered the world in sin,&mdash;I
have lived in anxiety, and I depart in perturbation.
Cause of causes, pity me, poor
Aristotle.” We ruminate with our bewildered
eyes riveted on vacancy, and suddenly resolve
to divulge all to the Reverend Doctor Potts,
and at a bound are in his dazzling habitation,
close by his side, whom thus rudely do we accost:
“We are a stranger, on a mission of
love and duty. What we disclose will appal,
and you may lose your sacred temper, and
drive us from your presence. But, as we came
to save your daughter from the embraces of a
villain, if you violate our person, we shall
yearn for a terrible revenge, and may, in
our awful wrath, slay you in your own domestic
castle.” He paled and trembled,&mdash;his
eyes glistened and lips quivered, and his hair
actually arose. We told him to be as serene
as the morning sky without, as we had come,
like the Saviour, to rescue his beauteous child
from ruin, and himself, and wife, and other
children from eternal degradation; and that
what we should disclose, must be concealed
in his heart’s most secret recesses, until the
curfew tolled the departure of his final sun, to
which he most solemnly assented. And then
we divulged all we have here narrated, when
he arose, and, with his hands clasped, he cried
in tones of melting tenderness: “What! my
daughter! my darling child, who is the hope
and solace of my being, to drop notes for Otto
Dressel in Houston street! Impossible, sir&mdash;impossible&mdash;utterly
impossible. Mr. Dressel
is a great pianist, and came to this country
with letters to me from the leading men of
Germany, and I have the highest confidence
in his integrity, and I permit him to visit my
family, and he often passes his leisure in my
house, and teaches music to my daughter, and
they often sit for hours at the piano, and play
duets and sing together like brother and sister;
and I think they admire, but do not love
each other, as she is betrothed to a southern
gentleman of great affluence. Otto I love,
and so does my wife, and other children, and
we treat him like one of us; but my eldest
daughter simply admires, but cannot love him
without infidelity to her betrothed. All her
purest and most sacred affections are concentrated
on another. But Otto will ever be
welcome to my house, for I like his delightful
music and his modest demeanor, and I cannot
and will not believe that he could be guilty
of dishonorable stratagem, to rob me of my
favorite child. It is impossible, and I will not
believe it.” We arose, and smiled, and departed
with the usual courtesy of departure.
And soon we received the following, which we
punctuate and italicise precisely as we received
it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“<i>To Mr. Branch</i>: Dear Sir&mdash;It has just
occurred to me, that I owe you a line, to express
again my thanks for the manly straightforward
way in which you brought to <i>me</i> the
derogatory scandal you had heard. Far better
such a method of dealing, than that of
talking <i>about</i> people of whom we have heard
disparaging statements&mdash;and far better than
anonymous letter-writing, which shoots arrows
in the dark. Although the affair you
brought to my ears&mdash;plausible as seemed the
statements you rec’d&mdash;had no farther foundation,
than the passing of notes about indifferent
matters&mdash;still I am none the less obliged
to you for the manner in which you made it
known to me. My promise of holding you
harmless, is the only reason, why I do not call
upon the parties named, and take them to task.
This, however, I cannot do, without your permission&mdash;nor
perhaps is it of any importance
I should. I may, however, suggest to yourself
a good office toward the young person,
with whom this story, (which owes its plausibility
to a little fact, and a good deal of suspicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
fancy,) originated: namely to warn
her <i>of the danger</i> of letting her imagination
and her tongue run away with her. Respectfully
yours,</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">George Potts</span>.</p>

<p>Nov. 9, 1849.</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">P. S.&mdash;If it should be at all in your power,
you would oblige me if you could verify the
story of the dropping of notes, and who the
person (if such an one there be) is.”</p>


<p class="pc1">HERE IS OUR REPLY.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">New York City</span>, Nov. 12, 1849.</p>

<p><i>To the Rev. Dr. Potts</i>: Dear Sir&mdash;Your
approval of my course is truly grateful to my
feelings. On my return to my abode on the
day I saw you, my interrogations elicited the
following which I forward as an answer to
your request in your postscript, although I
supposed I had sufficiently verified all I disclosed.
Miss Mitchell says that she knows
your daughter, when she sees her, and her
mother and two nieces also know her by
sight; that the Saturday previous (three days
prior to my visit to you), she saw your daughter
ascend the steps, ring the bell, request the
servant (who is in collusion with Dressel and
your daughter), to hand a note to Mr. Dressel,
and depart as far as the corner of Sullivan
and Houston streets, where she tarried until
Mr. Dressel (leaving immediately on the receipt
of the note in his room) overtook her,
when they walked away together, arm in
arm, and that similar scenes occurred while
Mr. Dressel boarded with them in Bond street,
last Winter, where the correspondence began,
which has also been conducted through the
Dispatch Post ever since, Mr. Dressel sometimes
receiving as many as three letters per
week; that a colored boy has sometimes
brought the letters; that these letters (at least
those Miss Mitchell perused, at Mr. Dressel’s
request,) comprised six closely written pages,
with the name of your daughter annexed, beginning
with: “My dear, dear Otto:” and with
“My dearest and very best friend,” &amp;c.; that
these letters bear the impress, on the seal, of
“Happiness,” “Pain,” “Eye,” &amp;c; that Mr.
Dressel has your daughter’s daguerreotype,
which has been open on the piano, in the parlor
of Mrs. Mitchell, or on the piano or bed in
Mr. Dressel’s apartment. Now, my dear Sir,
if all this be fallacious, Miss Mitchell deserves
a severe retribution. Time will show as to
its truth. I am equally the friend of Mr.
Dressel, and of the family of Mrs. Mitchell,
and of your own family, all of whom are
strangers to me in the light of consanguinity,
and nearly by association, save as the boarder
of Mrs. Mitchell now and hitherto. But if I
can save your daughter from the dreadful
calamity of elopement, and her parents from
the deep mortification and anguish that would
arise therefrom, I assure you that I will do so,
come what may. The pride and glory of your
family, and of a large circle of acquaintance
and friends, shall not be suddenly and surreptitiously
sacrificed forever, if I can avert it.
So, my dear Sir, you can command my services
as you please, in a rational way, in all
this business. I repeat what I said at our interview,
(in reply to your assertion of implicit
confidence in your daughter,) that you must
not lose sight of the frailties of our nature,
with its unreliable and treacherous impulsions,
nor of the power of genius, nor the extraordinary
fascinations of music (in the hands
of a great master), over the delicate, unsophisticated,
and enthusiastic mind of a female,
with kindred musical genius; and that even
opposing natures often form alliances of friendship
and matrimony.</p>

<p class="pr4">From your friend,</p>
<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Stephen H. Branch</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">To Rev. Dr. George Potts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>N. B.&mdash;I trust you will excuse the haste
with which this letter was written, owing to
the arrival of friends from California, on yesterday.</p>

<p class="pr4">S. H. B.</p>

<p class="p1">Time rolls! Mr. Perkins, a young lawyer,
(formerly of Natchez, but who had removed
to New Orleans,) comes North, and marries
the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Potts, and they
sail for Paris, where he discovers in her trunk
the very letters that Dressel wrote her while
at Mrs. Mitchell’s, in response to her “drop
notes,” and also letters from Dressel that she
had just received in Paris, which were enclosed
in her mother’s letters from New York.
Terrible scenes transpire, resembling those
between Othello and Desdemona, and she
flies from him in terror, and conceals herself
in Paris, and writes to her father, who goes
to Paris and accompanies her to America,
when he immediately sends for us, and weeps
in our presence, and deeply regrets that he
had not adopted our advice, and driven Dressel
into the street, who, with the imprudence of
his own wife, in inclosing Dressel’s letters to
his daughter in Paris, had plunged his family
into irremediable ruin. Perkins returns and
goes to the Irving House, at the corner of
Chambers street and Broadway, where we
had frequent interviews, when he cries like a
little child, and denounces Mr. and Mrs. Potts,
but defends the chastity of his wife, and regrets
his passion and his furious anathema of
her in Paris. The matter is thrown into the
Courts, and Perkins employs Daniel Lord,
William Kent, and Benjamin F. Butler, and
Potts engages Wm. Curtis Noyes, Ogden Hoffman,
and &mdash;&mdash; Staples, and both Perkins and
Potts strive to induce us to testify in their
favor, and because we peremptorily refused,
and assured them we should disclose the truth
on the stand, they dared not call the case for
trial, lest our testimony would overwhelm
both parties, and consign them to eternal
odium and misery. Perkins obtained a divorce,
and was elected to Congress, and married
a Southern lady. Miss Potts remains
single, and is a noble ornament of society.
One of Mrs. Mitchell’s nieces was seduced by
a monster, and had a child, and she soon
became a prostitute, and her mother a
lunatic. Julia Mitchell married a Southron,
who professed great wealth, but proved to be
a pauper, and a villain of the deepest calibre.
Julia obtained a divorce, and married a Mr.
Moffat, who was also supposed to be immensely
affluent. Mrs. Mitchell died, and her
other niece resides with Mrs. Julia Moffat.

<p class="p1">Reclining on the velvet banks of the Hudson,
were Mayor Kingsland and little Georgy,
with steamers, and mariners, and forests, and
the full round moon, and radiant stars reflected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the placid waters. With segars,
and wine, and luscious cream before them,
Georgy said: “Kingsland: I came from Brandon
in the ship Perseus, in 1817, and was a
valiant youth. Patrick Dickey was a passenger,
with 400 others. We exchanged vessels
at Halifax, and tarried several months at
Perth Amboy, and resided in Banker street,
(the Fifth Avenue of those days,) and at Niblo’s
Garden, where my father was a fashionable
Broadway dandy tailor, on whose big
sign was ‘George Matsell, Tailor, from London.’
Our residence was the first brownstone
mansion erected on Broadway. My
father was of the Paine, Wright, and Owen
creed, which I early imbibed. My brother
Augustus was the Secretary of Fanny Wright,
and I was her enthusiastic disciple, and sold
her books, and pretty pictures, which were
not obscene, and for which I was not indicted;
nor were my associates imprisoned thirty days
in the Tombs, whom I induced to visit America.
Through Fanny Wright and George II.
Purser, (who was the favorite of Fanny,)
and Robert Dale Owen, I became a Custom
House officer, under Martin Van Buren, and
a Police Justice under Mayor Varian, and
Chief of Police under Mayor Havemeyer, with
whom and all his successors I had great influence.
I pulled the nose of every Mayor
save Havemeyer, whom I found extremely
mulish; and yet I made him fear me when I
chose. Although my salary was small, yet I
realized a stupendous fortune like yourself,
since you began your political career in the
First Ward, as a shoulder-hitter, and a
candidate for Assistant Alderman, and successful
municipal oil contractor. We understand
these political ropes and wires, Kingsland,
and it is unnecessary to linger on them.
You are on the Fifth Avenue, in a Persian
Palace, while I adhere to Stanton street, in a
humble dwelling, lest I be suspected by my
enemies of acquiring vast treasures through
my office of Chief. I think you commit a
fatal error in your display of magnificence,
but I’ll not murmur, as all are responsible for
their own sins and imprudence. You may
have a boisterous career, and a gust may
arise, like that of Astor Place, when you may
require my services. My coolness and intrepidity
on that occasion, saved the city from
universal massacre and conflagration. I judiciously
remained in the Opera House, and
commanded Woodhull, Talmadge, Westervelt
and Sandford, to fire at the mob in the street,
or all would have been lost, and the city instantly
demolished, and its inhabitants butchered
and burned to bleeding fragments and
Kansas cinders. I was in the stage-box
throughout the frightful spectacle, lest from
my immense fat, I might be as palpable a
target for the foe, as Daniel Lambert, my remotest
ancestor on my Daddy’s side. Lambert
is from Lamb, a word of Brandon origin,
and hence the mildness of my disposition,
although I am terrible in bloody conflicts,
where the fate of a city is involved. And the
eye of Providence was in my appointment
by Havemeyer, and my skillful and courageous
direction of the entire Astor Place
riots. The Mayor, Recorder, Sheriff, and the
General, were pale and timid, and faltered,
and it required the lungs of Knox, (who could
bellow into the ears of Washington across the
icy and tumultuous atmosphere of the Delaware,)
and the nervous fat of an immediate
descendant of Lambert, and the herculean
vigor of Sampson, and the impetuosity of Putnam,
to brave the demons of Astor Place
who strove to exterminate my countryman
the gallant, and graceful, and intellectual
Macready, who was right in the introduction
of a dance in Hamlet, as Hamlet’s grandfather
was a dancing master to the King
of Denmark, and hence Ned Forrest had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
right to hiss Macready for his testimonial of
respect to Hamlet’s grand-father. Shakespeare,
himself, was long a correspondent of
Hamlet’s grand-father, and introduced the
dance in Hamlet from his respect to his old
friend, which Johnson ejected during the
very year that Shakespeare died, because he
had a quarrel with Hamlet’s grand-father in a
ball-room, in Denmark, when Johnson not
only got licked, but had his nose broken in
five places, besides the horrible and irremediable
fracture of its tip end. This is
the gist of the whole Astor Place quarrel,
and MacCready was familiar with all these
historical truths, and hence his introduction of
the dance in Hamlet. I saved the city and
MacCready, and by adroit tactics I saved myself,
by adhering to the stage box, (with a pistol
in either hand,) until the massacre was
over in the street, and the exasperated populace
had dispersed, when I rushed into the
open air, and knocked down a blind-crippled-music-grinder,
and brandished my sword and
pistols ferociously, and frightened a little boy
almost to death, who was inquiring for his
mother. It was hard for me to order the
Mayor, Recorder, Sheriff, and General, to fire
upon the Americans; but my duty to a fellow-countryman
in peril, and to myself, and
to the people, whose alien Chief I was,&mdash;and,
above all, to a God, in whom I ardently believe,
and love, and fear, and into whose eternal
embrace I expect to go, demanded me to
indirectly give the thrilling and fatal word of
fire, which hurled a score of beings into the
dreary entrails of the globe, and into the sudden
and awful presence of our common Deity.
And now, Kingsland, my dear boy, in
view of my tried courage, and my prodigious
influence with the file of Mayors who have
preceded you, and of my aid to you in primary
elections, and of my powerful recent secret
support of you in your nomination and
election&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you know, Kingsland,
all the rest. I say that, in view of all this, I
desire you to let me remain as Chief of Police,
for which I will cling to you as I did to
Fanny Wright, and Robert Dale Owen, and
George H. Purser, and to the City of New
York in its hour of peril. Do this, my dear
Kingsland, and I will lobby through the Common
Council the Ganzevoort jobs, and all the
oil contracts you desire, and let you go where
you please unmolested; and you can join
Messrs. Paine &amp; Phalon in musical, or lottery
and policy operations, and buy as many
millions of dollars’ worth of land in Williamsburgh
and Greenpoint, and own as many licentious
houses in Church, and Leonard, and
other streets, as you desire, and I will not cull
a solitary hair from your beautiful and conscientious
skull. What is your response?”</p>

<p><i>Kingsland.</i>&mdash;“Have I not declared that you
were my first choice for Chief of Police?”</p>

<p><i>Matsell.</i>&mdash;“Yes. But that was only a verbal
declaration. I desire the bird in my own
cage. I want the fascinating documents under
your signature.”</p>

<p><i>Kingsland.</i>&mdash;“Waiter: Bring me pen, ink
and paper. [Writes.] There, Matsell, there it
is, but do not use it until I see my political
friends, and conciliate them with the assurance
that your appointment was absolutely
essential to the preservation of the Metropolis
from riots, and sword, and fire, and ashes. If
I fail to allay their exasperation, I shall send
them to you, and if you fail to pacify them
with promises of appointment, and those
sweet accents that flow like Stuart’s syrup
from your ruddy lips, and your oriental bows,
and meek scrapes, and cringing smiles,&mdash;why,
then, you must put your bloodhounds on their
track on howling tempest nights, (when only
owls dare prowl through the fearful darkness
of ether,) who will pursue them to the
dens of infamy and revelry, and blasphemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and obscenity, and dicery, when you will have
them in your awful clutches, as you have me.
O, God! Matsell, I hardly know what I say.
Wine works wonders, and now let us fill our
glasses to the brim, and have another dulcet
cream, and depart for the Metropolis,&mdash;and at
our nocturnal farewell, let us kneel and swear
beneath the universal concave, that we will
cling to each other like Damon and Pythias,
or Burr and Arnold, until our wormy conquerors
begin their happy feast, and grin and
dance over our silent and icy forms in the
dreary and awful sepulchre. But remember
my oil and other contracts, Matsell. Be piously
true to them. When we next meet, I’ll
tell you how to effect their continuation with

your limited experience.”</p>

<h2>Supervisor Blunt.</h2>


<p>Two more public documents, written by
Stephen H. Branch for Orison Blunt, who
was Alderman of the Third Ward in 1854,
and Alderman of the Fifteenth Ward in 1857,
and is now Supervisor from the Fifteenth
Ward.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">[From the N. Y. Herald, April 22, 1851.]</p>

<p class="pc"><b>Paul Julien’s Second Concert.</b></p>

<p>The youthful artist has created a perfect
<i>furore</i> in musical circles&mdash;amateurs, professionals,
<i>dilettanti</i> and every body else; his
talent is wonderful, and his improvement still
more remarkable. He has, withal, the modesty
which is the companion of true merit. His
second concert was given at Niblo’s Saloon,
on Thursday evening, and it was attended by
as full and fashionable an audience as that
which welcomed him on Tuesday evening.
Mayseder’s grand variations were given for
the second time, upon a single string; the
second attempt was even more successful than
the first, and the young artist gave the highest
proof of genius in overcoming difficulties
previously regarded as insurmountable. Another
gem of the soiree was a duet for violin
and piano-forte, by Julien and Richard Hoffman.
It was capitally given and was encored.
The vocal part of the concert was given by
Mme. Commettant and M’lle. Henrietta Behrend.
The enthusiasm of the audience at the
matchless execution of Julien was unbounded.</p>

<p>But an episode occurred yesterday which
was more telling in its effects than the applause
of the audience on Thursday evening.
It was a grand “variation” in the form of
five one thousand dollar bank notes, a gift to
the young musical genius. The following extraordinary
letters describe the affair:</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, April 21, 1854.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Master Paul Julien</i>: I have heard your
delightful music in the Concert room, and
you have had the kindness to play for myself
and friends at my residence. In earlier life I
strove to learn the violin, but I abandoned it
as too difficult for me. Its intricacies are unconquerable
to all save those who are inspired.
I have heard of the extraordinary perseverance
and severe pecuniary trials through
which your father has passed, to impart to
you, his only child, a musical education. And
I deem the efforts of both father and son
highly commendable, and truly worthy of encouragement.
I therefore present you with
five thousand dollars, which I trust will be
consecrated to your intellectual, musical, and
moral culture.&mdash;Sincerely,</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Orison Blunt</span>.</p>

<p class="pc reduct">[<i>Turn over for Paul’s response.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="pr2 p1">New York, April 21, 1854.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>My Dear Sir</i>:&mdash;Mere words, though brightly
glowing with affection, could not express
my grateful emotions for your unexampled
munificence. Nor could the most stirring
strains I ever expect to conceive, reflect the
chords you have touched in my heart. I can
only assure you, that I will be very studious,
and fondly cherish you next to my father and
mother. I may soon return to France, and if
you should ever visit me, I am sure that my
friends would cordially receive you, for your
substantial kindness to me during my sojourn
in a far distant land. Affectionately,</p>

<p class="pr2"><span class="smcap">Paul Julien</span>.</p>

<p class="pn1">Alderman Orison Blunt,</p>
<p>Warren street, New York.</p>

<p class="p1">We led Alderman Blunt into this, and we
trust the public will not censure him, but lash
us most unmercifully for such a vile imposture.
Blunt never gave a cent to Paul Julien,&mdash;and
when we asked him some time afterwards, to
aid Paul, he declined; but Alderman Thomas
Christy gave Paul $80, to relieve himself and
father and mother. When we had our last
sad interview with Madame Sontag, just prior
to her fatal departure for Mexico, by way of
the Lakes, (in a conversation of three hours
at her room in the Mansion House in Albany)
she assured us there never was such a talented
youth as Paul Julien, and that she had
adopted him, and warmly besought us never
to desert him, not only as his private teacher,
but as his pecuniary friend, and we most
solemnly promised we would not. After Sontag
died in Mexico, Paul became very poor,
and as we were also indigent, we hatched this
stratagem to deceive the public, and create
excitement, and fill a concert room for Paul,
and we asked Blunt to sign this sham letter,
which he did. We have ever been disgusted
with this wicked imposition, and have suffered
the compunction of a penitent thief, and
we now dash the odium from our conscience,
as a midnight spider prowling round our nose.
And as it is the only Barnum and Ullman operation
in which we ever were enlisted, we trust
and believe that the public will forgive us.</p>

<p>James Gordon Bennett knew nothing of
our imposition, nor did Frederick Hudson, his
Private Secretary, until the present week,
when we disclosed the whole infamous proceeding
to Mr. Hudson.</p>

<h2>Fun, and Sun, and Shade.</h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Frances Fauvel Gouraud</span>, the mnemonic lecturer
of 1843, gave gold pencils and other gilded
trinkets to males, and reticules to females. John
Innman was editor of the <i>Commercial Advertiser</i>,
to whom he gave a massive gold pencil, and desired
to give a reticule to his fair lady, who was sister of
the once famous Clara Fisher, and now Mrs. Maeder.
The day was warm, and the cholera diarrhœa was
prevalent, and he loudly rings the bell, and dashes
into the house with all the enthusiasm of a Frenchman,
and screams: “Mrs. Innman: Have you got
one <i>necessaire</i>?” She is dumb for seconds, and her
lily cheeks are balls of fire, and indignant phrenzy
glares in her eyes, when she proclaims: “I will
call the servant,” and furiously retires. The servant
darts in and balls out: “Come hither sir,” and
on he tramps, behind the servant, into the basement
and the yard, where he is politely escorted
into the <i>necessaire</i>, when he savagely ejaculates:
“The <i>diable</i>! You von tam skamp! Why for
you take me in dis vile place? By gar! by dam!

unions in dis country? You one tam rascal! What

<p><i>Gouraud</i>&mdash;“Yes&mdash;dat we admit for de argument&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
they are such tam pig holes, dat de

Why does for you laugh right in my face? Me
will break your tam head if you laugh at me. A

French beautiful and sublime and very glorious

<p><i>Servant</i>&mdash;“You perhaps had better see Mr. Innman,
as it would not be proper to explain such
a thing to Mrs. Innman.”</p>

<p><i>Gouraud</i>&mdash;(Seizing the servant by the throat)&mdash;“You
are one tam villain, and me tell you me
must see Mrs. Innman, for to ask her pardon, or
Mr. Innman will give me no more puffs of
my astonishing System of Mnemotechny. Me

<p><i>Gouraud</i>&mdash;“Bury well&mdash;bury well&mdash;and me will

<p><i>Servant</i>&mdash;(returns) “I have explained everything
to Mrs. Innman, who says that she hopes
you will excuse her from an explanatory interview,
and regrets that <i>necessaire</i> has been confounded
with something less fragrant, and that she is very
sorry she had you escorted into the yard.”</p>

<p><i>Gouraud</i>&mdash;Seizes both hands of the servant, and
dances, and runs him up and down the parlor like
fury, and cuts half a dozen pigeons’ wings with
his buoyant legs, and sings Marseilles, and darts
out of the house, and down the street, as though
a creditor was after him; and in the far perspective,
with his elastic step and fancy and frantic gesticulation,
evinces a wild delight that resembles
the ecstacies of Elysium.</p>

<h2>Our Beloved Brethren of the Press.</h2>

<p class="p1">The Reporters of the Common Council have
received 200 dollars each for their laborious services,
which is a happiness to us beyond expression.
We know their generous emotions, and
their evening toil in a sickly atmosphere, some
of whom have the ability and genius to wield
the destinies of a city or nation. Although Horace
Greeley recently told us that he had never
been in the Board of Aldermen, and would
hardly know where to find it, yet James Gordon
Bennett has told us that he served a terrible apprenticeship
as a Reporter of the Common Council,
more than a quarter of a century since, and we
know that most of the metropolitan editors were
Municipal Reporters prior to their present exalted
and lucrative, and powerful position as public
journalists. Even before we baptised the <i>Alligator</i>,
we had to endure the tortures of a ten years’ pilgrimage
around the corners and through the
subterranean caverns of the City Hall. But no
more of this. We sincerely congratulate our
Reportorial friends, on the reception of a trifling
remuneration for their severe and honorable

<h2>Life of Stephen H. Branch.</h2>

<p class="p1">My brother Albert came to New York without
the knowledge of father, and I got him a situation
at the Harpers. I shall never forget how hard I
besought John Harper to employ Albert, who did
not want a boy, but kindly employed him to please
me. Albert had the salt rheum, and also had very
small and spiteful yellow bugs on the surface of
his cranium. As I had to sleep with him, I combed
his head every day, and when I found one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the little villains, I most cruelly tortured him with
pins and flame, to terrify his brethren who remained,
and to thwart his return to Albert’s head. But
in spite of my bloody precaution, poor Albert’s
skull teemed like Egypt of old, with ferocious animals,
and I retired with him at night, invested with
the fear of a culprit on his march to the scaffold.
The yellow scamps made such a Napoleonic resistance,
that I procured a finer comb, and in my violent
efforts to drag out and exterminate the enemy,
(who were deeply embedded and irresistibly fortified
in his invulnerable skull,) poor Ally screamed,
like an eagle on his cliff, and Mrs. Harper came to
the basis of the attic stairs, and severely scolded us
for quarrelling and fighting, as she supposed. Mrs.
Harper was extremely nervous, and fearing she
would learn that Albert had battalions of animalculæ
in the region of his brain, and also trembling
lest they would ground arms, and encamp and form
tents in my luxuriant intellectual foliage, I advised
Albert to return to Providence, and after long persuasion,
with candy and peanuts, and peaches, he
assented, and I went to Captain Bunker, Junior,
who kindly consented to take him to Providence,
without charge. While leaning on the railing of
the steamer, with our eyes on the beautiful panorama
of the bay, Captain Bunker told me that my
lot was cast in a vicious city, and that I must resist
evil temptation, and always be a good boy,
and become a worthy man, and breathed other kind
words into my ears, which soothed my lonely
and inexperienced heart, made me cry vociferously,
and I have always cherished him with the
purest affection. Albert went to Providence with
Captain Bunker, but instead of going to father’s, he
proceeded to Boston with the money John Harper
gave him, and thence to Eastport, Maine, where
the yellow bugs increased so rapidly, that he was
compelled to return to Providence, where father
had his head shaved, which presented a bloody
battle plain, full of teeming entrenchments, and
his yellow foes so bewildered him, that the
hospital nurses had to watch him closely, for several
days, lest he would destroy himself.</p>

<p>John Harper often called me from the composing
to the counting room, and sent me to the Banks
in Wall street to get or deposit money. I often
contemplated the robbery of the Harpers, by
flight to a foreign land; but when I reviewed their
exact justice to all men, and their kindness to myself
and brother Albert, and to all their apprentices,
journeymen, and laborers, I would falter in my
wicked purpose. While returning from bank
with a $500 bill, I dropped it by design, and
asked a stranger if he had lost it, who said yes, and
strove to seize it from the pavement, but I was
about one second in his advance. While about to
run, he seized me and demanded the return of his
$500 bill. I cried and screamed lustily, and during
the scuffle, two gentlemen came to my relief,
when my antagonist soon fled, and I run down Cliff
street, like a bloodhound. Better time was never
made from the old pump of Saint George’s to the
Harpers. I never again pretended to lose a $500
bill.</p>
